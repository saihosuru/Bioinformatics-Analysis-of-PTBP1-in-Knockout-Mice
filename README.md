# Bioinformatics-Analysis-of-PTBP1-in-Knockout-Mice


In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of previous datasets to investigate the effect of knocking out PTBP1 in mice on the conversion of astrocytes to neurons, utilizing tools in bioinformatics and machine learning. Existing studies have presented conflicting evidence regarding the impact of PTBP1 knockout, prompting us to reanalyze available datasets to draw new conclusions. Our findings suggest that PTBP1 knockout does indeed result in the creation of a new cell type resembling neurons, as indicated by the differential expression of specific genes. In conclusion, our analysis supports the notion that PTBP1 plays a role in converting astrocytes to neurons.

# Research Question
We aimed to investigate whether knocking out the PTBP1 gene leads to the conversion of astrocytes into neurons in the mouse cortex. This research is significant as it may have implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, which are characterized by the loss of neurons. We utilized bioinformatics tools to analyze sequencing data to determine if PTBP1 removal increases the number of neurons.
